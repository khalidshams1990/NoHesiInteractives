        <!-- About Us section -->
        <h1 class="header-1-font-size">About Us</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-font-size">Our project is a collaborative effort by a group of four programmers who are passionate about creating a realistic driving simulator. Our aim is to develop a simulator that offers an immersive experience with a variety of cars, each meticulously crafted to have its own unique handling and feel.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph-font-size">In our simulator, every car will behave differently based on engine placement, drivetrain type, and weight distribution. Through advanced algorithms and programming techniques, we're striving to simulate the intricacies of real-world driving dynamics. The way each car is set up will influence its behavior, allowing for a dynamic and engaging experience that evolves with your driving style, as well as showcasing the pros and cons of each main drivetrain type and weight distribution.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph-font-size">We're dedicated to delivering a realistic and enjoyable driving simulation that caters to both casual players and enthusiasts alike, clearly showcasing the differences in car behavior based on the setup the player goes with.</p>
